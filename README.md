# Groops Backend API üåç

**Backend API for activity-based group creation and participation**

**Live API:** `https://groops.fun`

This is the **backend-only** Go API that powers the Groops platform. For the frontend React application, see the separate `groops-react` directory.

## What is Groops?

Groops is a social platform that helps people create and join activity-based groups. Whether you want to organize a basketball game, find hiking buddies, or start a book club, Groops makes it easy to connect with like-minded people in your area.

## Features

- **Group Creation & Management** - Create groups for any activity
- **Smart Discovery** - Find groups by activity type, location, skill level, and more
- **Join Requests** - Organizers can approve who joins their groups
- **Location Integration** - Find groups near you with map integration
- **Notifications** - Stay updated on group activities and requests
- **Event Reminders** - Automatic email reminders before events
- **User Profiles** - Customizable profiles with ratings and activity history

## How It Works

1. **Sign up** with your Google account
2. **Create your profile** with username and bio
3. **Discover groups** in your area or create your own
4. **Join groups** that interest you (with organizer approval)
5. **Get reminders** before events so you never miss out
